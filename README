Google Weather Widget for Awesome Window Manager

This widget grabs weather data from Google's API based on a postal code and allows you to display it as an awesome textbox widget. The widget will display the current temperature (in F) and will have a tooltip with more details. The widget checks for updates every 10 minutes.

Installation:
1. Clone this repo to ~/.config/awesome

2. Add the following to your rc.lua (123456 being your postal code)

  require('weather')
  forecast = widget({ type = "textbox", name = "weather" })
  weather.register(forecast, 123456)

3. Add forecast to your wibox widgets. Mine looks like:

  mywibox[s].widgets = {
    {
      mylauncher,
      mytaglist[s],
      mypromptbox[s],
      layout = awful.widget.layout.horizontal.leftright
    },
    mylayoutbox[s],
    memwidget,
    cpuwidget,
    fswidget,
    batwidget,
    volwidget,
    forecast,
    mytextclock,
    s == 1 and mysystray or nil,
    mytasklist[s],
    layout = awful.widget.layout.horizontal.rightleft
  }


Your feedback is greatly appreciated!
